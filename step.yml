title: Xamarin Archive
summary: Generates deployable artifact, for example, an .ipa or an APK file for your Xamarin application.

description: |-
  This Step archives your Xamarin application and moves the generated files to the deployment folder. From there, the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step picks up the files and moves them to **APPS & ARTIFACTS**. Feel free to check them out. You can deliver the archived files to the respective marketplace by adding a delivery Step to your Workflow.

  ###Configuring the Step
  1. Set the the location of your Xamarin solution file in the **Path to the Xamarin Solution file** input.
  1. Set the **Xamarin solution configuration** input to the Xamarin project Configuration you wish to use (for example, `Release`).
  2. Set the target platform of your solution configuration in the **Xamarin solution platform** input (for example, `iPhone`).

  ###Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the **Xamarin Archive** Step after the relevant code signing Step and before any delivery Step. For example, if you're archiving an .ipa file, make sure you have uploaded the code signing files to Bitrise and have the **Certificate and profile installer** Step in your Workflow. For APK file generation, you will need to upload your keystore file and have the **Android Sign** Step in your Workflow.
